# Comparative-Analysis-of-Regression-Models-for-Laptop-Price-Prediction-Application
I compare and evaluate the performance of four popular regression models - Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - to determine which algorithm performs best for predicting laptop prices. I use four different metrics to measure the performance and error of each algorithm, namely R2 Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. By comparing these metrics, The aim is to identify the most suitable model for predicting laptop prices
